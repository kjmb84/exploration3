Met during the Thriller Bark arc, aboard the ship of his old crew.

A musician talented with at least a guitar and piano. Obligatory Laboon reference.</div></div>

He makes his way through the Grand Line and the New world, accumulating new crew members and allies. Loves meat almost as much as his  friends/nakama.
